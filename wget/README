DESCRIPTION

Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web using HTTP(S) and FTP,
the two most widely used internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it
will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports
recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP sites -- you can use
Wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the web like a WWW
robot.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
