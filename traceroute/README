DESCRIPTION

The traceroute utility displays the route used by IP packets on their way to a
specified network (or Internet) host. Traceroute displays the IP number and host
name (if possible) of the machines along the route taken by the packets.
Traceroute is used as a network debugging tool. If you're having network
connectivity problems, traceroute will show you where the trouble is coming from
along the route.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
