DESCRIPTION

This package provides "less", a file pager (that is, a memory-efficient utility
for displaying text one screenful at a time). Less has many more features than
the basic pager "more". As part of the GNU project, it is widely regarded as the
standard pager on UNIX-derived systems.

For more information on the usage and available configuration options,
consult the following sections.
